# The Creature That Ate Sheboygan

## Introduction

Rising from the depths of Lake Michigan, the creature shook its massive head and looked north on Route 42. Slowly, it pulled its massive body from the waters and began trundling down the superhighway. The eighteen-wheelers it ate provided the steel needed to maintain its strength. Panicked reports from motorists and residents came pouring into police, army, and airforce stations and bases; but the reports were too incredible. Only when Manitowac vanished into the creature's insatiable, cavernous maw were the reports believed....And it was headed for Sheboygan. Trembling with apprehension, Milwaukee and Chicago lay beyond.

## The Playing Pieces

The playing pieces consist of 100 die-cut cardboard counters which represent human army, populace, police, firemen units, monsters, and game markers. The pieces are placed on, and moved across, the map during play.

### Sample Units

## Setup for Play

### Purchasing Units and Strengths

Depending on the scenario being played (see Section 14.0), each player will be allocated a certain number of Initial Strength Points to purchase human units or strengths for his monster. The Human Player chooses which units he will control by expending Initial Strength Points. The Human Player receives all Populace units free. To buy other units, the Human Player must expend a number of Initial Strength Points equal to each unit's Combat Strength. The Human Player may not purchase more units of a given type than those that are provided in the countermix. The Human Player does not need to purchase firemen and fireboat units; these units will automatically appear if the monster chooses flame-breathing as a special ability.

The Monster Player allocates his Initial Strength Points to determine the Attack Strength, Defense Strength, Building Destruction Strength, Movement Allowance, and Special Abilities for his monster. Each Initial Strength Point allocated to a given strength or allowance increases that strength or allowance by 1 point. Thus if 4 Initial Strength Points were allocated to a monster's attack strength, his attack strength would be 4. Note: The Monster Player may never allocate more than 15 points to the monster's defense strength.

The Monster Player must also purchase special abilities for his monster. Each special ability has a specified Initial Strength Point cost (see 13.0). At least one-quarter of the monster's Initial Strength Points must be spent on special abilities.

### Initial Placement

Before the Human Player places his units in boxes on the map, the Monster Player secretly notes which of the four map edges his monster will use to enter the game. The Human Player then places all the units he purchased on the map. He may place each unit anywhere on the map (see 5.2), except that units may not be placed in boxes which are adjacent to a map-edge. One populace unit must be placed in each box containing a populace symbol.

After these units have been placed, the first GameTurn begins. In the first Monster Player-Turn, the monster must enter the map in some box adjacent to the map-edge the Monster Player designated before Human units were set up. The monster does expend Movement Points for entering this first box.

## Sequence of Play

### General Rule

The Creature That Ate Sheboygan is played in Game-Turns. Each Game-Turn is divided into a Monster Player-Turn and a Human Player-Turn; each Player moves and resolves combat in his respective turn.

#### A. Monster Player Turn

1. **Monster Movement Phase:** The Monster Player may move his monster up to the limit of its movement allowance. In addition, three times during its movement, the monster may pause to execute building destruction attempts. Destruction attempts are an effort to turn buildings on the map into rubble.
2. **Monster Combat Phase:** The Monster Player resolves all the attacks his monster makes against human units.

#### B. Human Player Turn

1. **Human Movement Phase:** The Human Player may move any or all of his units.
2. **Human Combat Phase:** The Human Player resolves all attacks by his units against the monster.
3. **Fire Phase:** First, all firemen and fireboat units able to put out fires may do so. Then the Human Player determines which way the wind is blowing, and if any fires on the map spread.

## Movement

### General Rule

The Creature That Ate Sheboygan uses a movement system in which the map is divided into boxes. A unit or monster is always considered to occupy one of the boxes drawn on the map. Note that some boxes are larger than others, and that some boxes are neither rectangular nor square in shape; this does not alter the fact that the box remains the definable area in which a unit or monster may be present.

When a unit or monster moves out of a box, it may move to any adjacent box. Two boxes are considered adjacent only if there is a dividing line between the two boxes. Two boxes are not considered adjacent if they meet only at a point. In other words, diagonal movement is not allowed. Note that, as a result of the irregularity of the grid, a box may be adjacent to as few as three and as many as six other boxes.

When a Human unit or monster moves into a box, it expends Movement Points - how many depends on the type of terrain the box represents. A human unit or monster may expend Movement Points up to its movement allowance during its owning Player's Movement Phase. Any or all of a Player's units may be moved during his Movement Phase. Movement Points may not be transferred from unit to unit or accumulated from Game-Turn to Game-Turn, with one exception: if an armor unit and an artillery unit begin the Human Movement Phase stacked together, the armor unit may "tow" the artillery unit at a combined movement allowance of 3 for that turn.

### Effects of Terrain on Movement

- **[5.11]** The monster, armor, and artillery units are forbidden to enter low building or high building boxes. If a building box is reduced to rubble, the rubble box may be entered by these units or the monster.
- **[5.12]** Helicopter units may enter all boxes on the map, including boxes which are on fire.
- **[5.13]** Only helicopters, fireboats, and monsters may enter river boxes. Fireboats may only enter river boxes (see Section 9.0, however).
- **[5.14]** Three river boxes have "bridge" or "tunnel" boxes running through them. A bridge box is considered to cross a river box, but runs "over" it. A tunnel box crosses a river box, but runs "under" it. Although both boxes are in the same space, a unit is considered to be present in one of the two boxes. For movement purposes, bridges are adjacent to the river box they run over, plus the street boxes at either end of the bridge. Tunnels are adjacent only to the street boxes at either end of the tunnel. When tracing a Line of Sight through bridge/river or tunnel/river boxes, count the area as a single box. Note that units and monsters may only attack into tunnels from the adjacent street, while they may attack onto bridges from any adjacent box. If a bridge box is destroyed, only infantry units may subsequently enter that box (see 9.0). Units which can enter river boxes may continue to enter the river box (destroyed bridges do not block the river).
- **[5.15]** If a unit begins its Movement Phase adjacent to a box it could not normally enter due to insufficient Movement Points, it may enter that box by expending all its Movement Points. In other words, a human unit may always enter an adjacent box, unless it contains impassable terrain for that unit, or unless the move would violate stacking limits.

### Stacking

- **[5.21]** Only one monster may ever be present in a box. Two human units (maximum) may be stacked together in a box. Helicopter, firemen, and populace units do not count towards this limit; any number of helicopter, firemen, and populace units, plus two units of any other type, may be stacked in each non-river box.
- **[5.22]** Stacking limits apply only at the end of movement; i.e., human units may move through other human units in excess of stacking limitations, as long as the stacking limits are not violated at the end of the Movement Phase. Human units may never enter or move through a box containing a monster (except 8.0). Generally, a monster may not enter or move through a box occupied by any human unit. (Exceptions: 5.3, 13.25).
- **[5.23]** A monster with the special ability of flying may move through boxes containing human units. However, flying monsters may never enter a box containing a human helicopter unit. At the end of the monster's movement, the Monster Player must announce whether the monster remains flying or lands. If it lands (it may only land in passable, unoccupied boxes), human units may not enter that box during the next Human Movement Phase. If the monster remains in the air, human units (except for helicopters) may move into that box.

### Overrunning Human Non-Combat Units

- **[5.31]** A monster on the ground may enter or move through a passable box occupied solely by human non-combat units if its attack strength compared to the combined human defense strength gives an odds ratio of 6-1 or greater.
- **[5.32]** This is a special case involving expenditure of the monster's Attack Strength Points during movement. The Monster Player allocates the points necessary, destroys the human unit, and may resume movement if he has Movement Points remaining.
- **[5.33]** Monster Attack Strength Points used in this manner during the Movement Phase are considered expended and not available in the monster's Combat Phase immediately following.

### Terrain Effects Chart

(see inside back cover)

## Combat

### Procedure

To resolve an attack during a Combat Phase, compare the attack strength of the attacking human unit(s) or monster to the total defense strength of the defending monster or human units. The comparison is expressed as a ratio between Attacking and Defending Strength Points (Attacking Strength Points divided by Defending Strength Points) and is simplified by rounding down, in favor of the defender, to one of the odds ratios found on the Combat Results Table. Example: If thirteen Strength Points were attacking four, the combat odds ratio would be 3.25 to 1, rounded down to 3 to 1.

Having determined the Actual Combat Ratio, the attacker rolls a die. The result indicates a line on the Combat Results Table (6.4) which is cross-indexed with the column representing the combat ratio. The intersection of line and column yields a Combat Result. This result should be applied immediately to the involved human units or the monster before any further attacks are stated or resolved.

### Attacks by Units

- **[6.11]** A human combat unit adjacent to the box containing the monster may always attack the monster. Human units with a range greater than one may attack the monster from non-adjacent boxes, but only if they can trace a Line of Sight (LOS) to the monster, and if the monster is in range. Units with a parenthesized combat strength (such as firemen units) may never attack - only defend.
- **[6.12]** A human unit is able to trace of Line of Sight to a monster if a straight line can be drawn between any part of the box that the unit occupies to any part of the monster's box. Players may use a straight edge such as a ruler or a piece of paper to gauge LOS's. If the LOS passes through a building box, it is considered blocked, and the unit may not attack. Only high and low building boxes block Lines of Sight.
- **[6.13]** A unit is within range of a monster if the shortest path between the unit and the monster, traced through adjacent boxes, is less than or equal to the range of the unit. (Count the monster's box, but not the unit's box.) This path does not have to follow the straight line used to determine LOS; it should be the shortest path.

Boxes which touch only at a corner point are not considered adjacent.
- **[6.14]** During the Human Combat Phase, the Human Player may either total the combat strengths of all attacking units into a single total and conduct one massive attack, or he may resolve the attacks of each unit separately, or he may use some mixture of the two methods (i.e., total units into two or three attacks). Each attack is resolved individually. The effects of each attack are resolved before the next attack is made. The monster lends his full defense strength to each attack (unless one attack reduces the defense strength for the next).

### Attacks by the Monster

- **[6.21]** The monster may only attack units adjacent to his box, unless he has a special ability which allows him to make ranged attacks. If he does, rules 6.12 and 6.13 (LOS and range) apply to him as well.
- **[6.22]** The monster, unlike human units, has separate attack and defense strengths. He uses his defense strength when defending against attacks, and his attack strength when attacking units.
- **[6.23]** During his Combat Phase, the Monster Player may divide the monster's attack strength into as many parts as he likes, and then uses each part of his strength in a separate attack. He may also use his total attack strength in a single, massive attack. If a monster attacks into a box containing more than one human unit, he may attack any or all of the human units in that box. If he attacks only one unit, only that unit can suffer any combat result - the other units in the box remain unaffected. The monster may never attack firemen, helicopter, or populace units in a box, unless all other human units in the box are also attacked.
- **[6.24]** If a monster is forced to retreat after an attack, no further attacks by the monster may be conducted during that Phase.

### Combat Results

- **[6.31]** There are two types of combat result: losses and retreats. Results to the left of the slash on the Combat Results Table effect the Attacker; those to the right of the slash effect the Defender. Some combat results affect both the attacker and the defender. In this case, first the defender is affected, then the attacker.
- **[6.32]** A loss result is indicated by a number (1, 2, etc.). If the affected Player is the Human Player, he loses as many units as the number. Exception: Attacking units which are not adjacent to the monster are never affected by any combat result. If the number is greater than the number of units involved, all those units are lost. If the affected Player is the Monster Player, the monster takes as many points of damage as the number (see 12.0), unless he was attacking at a range greater than 1, in which case he takes no damage.
- **[6.33]** A retreat result is indicated by an "r1." If the affected Player is the Human Player, all units involved must be retreated (moved away from the monster) one box. Human units attacking at a range are never affected. Human units may not be retreated into the monster's box, not into a box adjacent to the monster, nor into an impassable box, nor into a box containing human units if the stacking limit would be violated. If a human unit has no place to retreat, it is destroyed and removed from play.

If the affected Player is the Monster Player, the monster must be retreated one box. It may not be retreated into an impassable box, nor into a box containing human units. If the monster has no place to retreat, it takes one point of damage and remains in place.

### Combat Results Table

(see separate sheet)

## Building Destruction

### General Rule

As many as three times during the Monster's Movement Phase, the monster may pause to attempt to destroy an adjacent building or bridge box. The monster ceases movement and a die is rolled to determine whether the box is destroyed. Thereafter, the monster may either make another destruction attempt or continue its movement.

### Procedure

The building destruction strength of a monster is determined by its Player before the game begins (see 3.0). Each turn, the Monster Player may allocate Building Destruction Points equal to the monster's current building destruction strength to as many as three separate destruction attempts. When the monster pauses to destroy a box, the owning Player determines how many Destruction Points the monster will allocate to the destruction attempt. The monster does not use its full building destruction strength in every destruction attempt; rather, the Monster Player determines how many points from the building destruction strength will be expended. The total number of Building Destruction Points expended by a monster in a single Player-Turn may never be greater than the monster's current building destruction strength.

After the owning Player has determined how many Building Destruction Points the monster will expend in one destruction attempt, the Players refer to the Terrain Effects Chart to determine the destruction strength of the box the monster is attempting to destroy. The number of Destruction Points expended by the monster is compared to the destruction strength of the box as an odds ratio, and this ratio is rounded down in favor of the box. That is, the same procedure used for resolving combat is used.

The Players then refer to the Building Destruction Results Table and roll a die. The appropriate row and column are determined. If the result is an "X," the box is destroyed.

### How a Building is Destroyed

- **[7.11]** If a box is destroyed, it is considered to be reduced to rubble. Place a rubble marker in the box; henceforth, the box is considered a rubble box, regardless of the terrain printed on the map in that box. Note that the monster may not enter building boxes, but may enter rubble boxes. Also, rubble boxes do not block LOS.
- **[7.12]** A destroyed bridge is not reduced to rubble, but does cease to exist. Place an inverted rubble marker on the bridge.
- **[7.13]** Units on a bridge box which is destroyed are destroyed with it. Units in other boxes which are destroyed are not affected.

### Building Destruction Results Table

(see separate sheet)

## Helicopter Units (Advanced Scenarios)

### General Rule

Helicopters do not count towards stacking limits (see 5.21). Helicopters may move through boxes containing monsters, but may not end a Movement Phase in such a box. If a Helicopter unit moves through a monster's box, a die is rolled. On a roll of 6, the monster is considered to have grabbed and eaten the Helicopter. Helicopters may move into any box on the map except one occupied by a monster in flight. They pay one Movement Point per box entered, regardless of terrain. Nothing ever blocks the LOS of a Helicopter unit. Helicopters are considered to fly higher than blocking terrain.

## Infantry Units

### General Rule

Infantry units normally act as regular human units. However, during any Human Combat Phase, an infantry unit next to the monster may make a "suicide assault." This means that the infantry unit's combat strength is doubled for that Combat Phase, but the unit is destroyed at the end of the attack, regardless of the combat result.

### Fording Rivers

An infantry unit may "ford" the river by expending its full movement allowance to enter a river box. During the subsequent Human Movement Phase, it once again expends its full movement allowance. It now enters the adjacent street box on the other side.

## Populace and Police

### General Rule

Populace units have a movement allowance of one, except when stacked with police. If a populace unit begins its Movement Phase stacked with a police unit, it may move with the police unit, at no cost to the police unit's movement allowance. The police unit may "drop" the populace off in any box along its path of movement. One police unit may move any number of populace units.

## Fire (Advanced Scenarios)

### General Rule

If the monster has the "breathe flames" special ability, it may start fires. It may pause up to three times during its movement in each Movement Phase and attempt to set any adjacent building or park box on fire. These attempts to start fires are resolved separately and independently from building destruction attempts. When a monster attempts to start a fire in a box, a die is rolled. On a roll of 1, 2, or 3, a fire is started in the box, and a flames marker is placed there.

### How Fires Burn

- **[11.11]** When a fire starts in a box, a flames marker is placed in the box with the number "1" facing towards the south edge of the map. In each Fire Phase, the marker is turned 90° clockwise. Thus, after one Fire Phase, the "2" side of the marker will point south; after two Phases, the "3" side will point south; and after three Phases, the "R" side will point south.
- **[11.12]** If the "R" side of the flames marker faces towards the south, it is considered to have become a rubble box, but it continues to burn. If the fire in the box is put out by firemen, a rubble marker is placed in the box, and the box may never again catch on fire. The monster does gain Victory Points for boxes reduced to rubble in this manner. This does not, however, increase his strength in the city eating scenario (see 14.25).
- **[11.13]** If a fire is put out before the "R" side of the marker is faced towards the south, the box is not reduced to rubble. If a fire is restarted in the box, the new flames marker begins with the "1" side facing the south again.

### How Fires Spread

- **[11.21]** During the Fire Phase of each GameTurn, a die is rolled to determine the direction of the prevailing winds. See the Wind Diagram on the map. If a 1, 2, 3, or 4 is rolled, the wind is considered to be blowing in the direction indicated by the Wind Diagram. A roll of 5 or 6 means that the air is calm.
- **[11.22]** During the Fire Phase, a die must be rolled for each building or park box adjacent to a box with a flames marker in it. If a 6 is rolled for a given box, the fire is considered to spread to that box, and a flames marker is placed there. If a box begins the Phase adjacent to two fire boxes, a 5 or 6 will start it on fire; if adjacent to three, a 4, 5, or 6 will do so; and so forth.
- **[11.23]** Wind may affect the spreading of fires. If a box is downwind from a box on fire (i.e., adjacent to a box on fire and the wind is blowing from the fire box's direction towards it), the chance of the box catching on fire is increased by one on the die-roll. Thus, a box downwind and adjacent to one box on fire would catch on fire with a die roll of 5 or 6.
- **[11.24]** If there is a street box intervening between a box on fire and another box, and the wind is blowing from the box on fire to the box across the street, the box across the street will catch on fire on a roll of six. That is, a box across the street from a box on fire is considered adjacent to the box on fire for fire-spreading purposes.
- **[11.25]** Only building and park boxes may be on fire. Other boxes (including rubble boxes) may not catch on fire, nor may fires be started in such boxes.

### Firemen

- **[11.31]** At the beginning of the Human Player's Movement Phase immediately following the first use by the monster of the fire breathing special ability, the Human Player receives firemen units. He may receive three firemen units and one fireboat unit, or four firemen units (his choice). The units may appear anywhere on the map at the discretion of the Human Player, except in the monster's box. The fireboat may only appear in a River box.
- **[11.32]** If a firemen unit begins the Fire Phase in a box with a flames marker in it, the firemen unit may put out the fire - i.e., the flames marker is removed.
- **[11.33]** At the beginning of the Fire Phase, the fireboat unit may put out fires in any two boxes that are within three boxes of the fireboat's box.

### Effects of Flames

- **[11.41]** If a non-firemen unit is in a box in which the monster starts a fire, or into which a fire spreads during the Fire Phase, a die must be rolled; on a roll of 1 or 2, the unit is eliminated. Units ending their Movement Phase in a box with a flames marker are eliminated. A monster in such a box immediately takes two points of damage. A unit in a box in which the monster starts a fire must be moved out in the next Movement Phase.

## Monster Record Sheets

### General Rule

The Monster Player should prepare a record sheet for his monster, listing each of the monster's strengths and special abilities (use a scrap piece of paper). The monster's attack strength, defense strength, building destruction strength, and movement allowance should be listed.

As a monster takes damage, its strengths are reduced. Each time the monster takes a point of damage, the Monster Player must reduce one of the monster's four strengths by one point (note this reduction on the record sheet). Which strength is reduced is entirely his choice. If a monster takes more than one point of damage in a given combat, the Monster Player may reduce several strengths, or may reduce one strength the full amount of Damage Points.

When the monster's defense strength is reduced to zero, the monster dies and the game is over.

The Monster Player never has to tell the other Player what any of the monster's offensive and movement strengths are, until the monster uses that strength. Similarly, the Monster Player never has to reveal what special abilities the monster has until the monster uses one. Exception: The Human Player always has the right to know what the monster's current defense strength and Victory Point levels are.

## Special Abilities

### General Rule

The Monster Player must "buy" special abilities for his monster (see 3.1). Each special ability has a cost in terms of Initial Strength Points allocated. Before placement, when the Monster Player allocates his monster's strengths, he may expend Initial Strength Points to purchase one or more special abilities for his monster.

### Flame and Attack Abilities (Advanced Scenarios)

- **[13.11] Flame Immunity (Cost: 2):** The monster may freely move through boxes containing Flame markers (as long as such boxes are not impassable to the Monster for other reasons).
- **[13.12] Fire Breathing (Cost: 8):** The monster may pause as many as three times during each Monster Movement Phase to attempt to cause a box to catch on fire. (See 11.0)
- **[13.13] Lightning Throwing (Cost: 6):** The monster may use its attack strength at a range of three hexes, i.e., it attacks as if it had a range of three. All rules that apply to units with ranges apply to the monster. Low buildings do not block the monster's LOS for lightning throwing, but high buildings do.

### Other Abilities

- **[13.21] Great Height (Cost: 5):** The monster is of such great size that, when he finally falls as a result of death, he will crush anything that he falls on. When the monster dies, the Monster Player may decide which box the monster falls in. This may be the monster's box, or any adjacent box. The box is reduced to rubble, and any units in the box are destroyed. The monster may grab a passing helicopter on a roll of 4, 5, or 6 (See 8.0).
- **[13.22] Web Spinning (Cost: 5):** The monster may, if it remains immobile for one full Monster Movement Phase, place a "web" marker in any two (or one) adjacent boxes. The box is impassable to all units (but not the monster, unless already impassable) for the remainder of the game. Additionally, any human units in a webbed box must spend two full Human Movement Phases cutting their way out of the webs, i.e., they must remain in that box. Human units so occupied may not attack the monster during the intervening Human Combat Phases. The web marker is removed only if fire spreads to the box.
- **[13.23] Fear Immobilization (Cost: 4):** The monster can immobilize its prey with fear the way vipers are reputed to. At the beginning of the Human Movement Phase, the Monster Player may designate any two human units within three boxes of the monster as being immobilized; neither of these units may move during that Movement Phase. The monster must be able to trace an LOS to the units in order to immobilize them. The immobilized units may attack the monster during the subsequent Combat Phase.
- **[13.24] Blinding Light (Cost: 4):** Twice during the game, the monster may flash with blinding light. During the subsequent Human Combat Phase, the monster may not be attacked by any human unit.
- **[13.25] Jumping Over Buildings/Units (Cost: 3):** The monster may move from any box to any other box that is within two boxes without passing through the intervening box. The destination box may not be impassable to the monster or occupied by an Enemy unit (although the box stepped over may be). The monster must pay twice the standard amount of Movement Points to enter the destination box.
- **[13.26] Radiation (Cost: 7):** The radiation disrupts radio communication between human units. Human units from different boxes may not combine in attacks on the monster; units in the same box may. Each attacking unit or stack must attack independently, and its attack is resolved separately of other units or stacks.
- **[13.27] Mind Control (Cost: 6):** Once during the game, the Monster Player may (during his Movement Phase) take over any one human unit. The unit must be within the LOS of the monster. The human unit is moved by the Monster Player during his Movement Phase, and attacks other human units at the direction of the Monster Player during the Monster's Combat Phase. The Monster Player controls the unit absolutely and completely, regardless of whether or not the unit remains in the Monster's LOS. The unit remains in "Monster Control" until (a) it is eliminated, or (b) the monster dies. If the unit is destroyed, the monster cannot take over another unit.
- **[13.28] Flying (Cost: 8):** The monster may either move normally or fly. If the monster is flying, it may move through any box including those occupied by Enemy units at a cost of one Movement Point. If the monster is flying during its Combat Phase, it may only attack Enemy units in its box, although Enemy units may always attack the monster from the monster's box or adjacent boxes. The monster may attack adjacent helicopter units. Similarly, the monster may only make destruction attempts on boxes it flies over. While flying, the monster may never enter boxes occupied by Enemy helicopter units, although it may enter boxes occupied by flame markers. Helicopter units may never enter a flying monster's box.

## Victory Conditions and Scenarios

### Victory Conditions

The game ends when the monster dies, or when all human units have been eliminated, or when the monster's victory level is exceeded. If all human units are eliminated, the Monster Player wins automatically. Otherwise, the Players total the number of Victory Points the Monster Player receives and refer to the scenario listings. If the total is greater than the monster victory level listed in the scenario, the Monster Player wins; if equal, the game is a draw.

The Monster Player receives 5 Victory Points for each populace unit eliminated; as many Victory Points for eliminating each unit as the combat strength (attack or defense) of non-populace units; 5 Victory Points for each destroyed low building box; 5 for each destroyed high building box; and 5 for each destroyed bridge box.

### Scenarios

- **[14.21] Learning Scenario:** The Human Player has 25 Initial Strength Points; the monster has 13. No special abilities or helicopters may be used. The monster victory level is 25 Victory Points.
- **[14.22] Basic Scenario:** The Human Player has 32 Initial Strength Points; the monster has 18. No helicopters or fire attack abilities (8.0, 13.1) are allowed. Monster victory level is 32 Victory Points.
- **[14.23] Advanced Scenario A:** The Human Player has 44 Initial Strength Points; the monster has 30. All rules are used, and the monster victory level is 40 Victory Points.
- **[14.24] Advanced Scenario B:** The Human Player has 60 Initial Strength Points; the monster has 40. All rules are used and the monster victory level is 55 Victory Points.
- **[14.25] City Eating Scenario:** The Human Player has 60 Initial Strength Points; the monster has 25. Each time the monster destroys a box, he may increase any of his strengths by two points (or two strengths by one point). For destroying other adjacent human units it may increase its strength by one point. All rules are used and the monster victory level is 55 Victory Points.

## Historical Notes

Results to left of slash are effects on attacker; those to right of slash are effects on defender. Attacks at a ratio of greater than 5-1 are resolved as 5-1; attacks at a ratio of less than 1-5 are prohibited.

Effects on Monster:
- 1, 2, 3 = indicated number of boxes must be checked off on monster's record sheet.
- r = monster must retreat one box.
